# Basic-Timer-Using-VanillaJS
Hello, I am learning Javascript from couple of days and this is just a project out of that learning . I made this project which is basically a timer and I have used HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript for this.

I have also taken help from https://fontawesome.com/ for play/pause icons used in the main index.html file. Apart from that, this small project is also a part of the course in Udemy by Stephen Grider
whose link is https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/ if anyone is interested to check it out. 

It still needs some enhancements and I might be updating the repository and this README next week hopefully if I am free. Thanks for reading. :)
